## About
The blogging api works on the principle of creating a post and having it read by other people. 

The general idea is that the api has a general endpoint that shows a list of articles that have been created by different people, and anybody that calls this endpoint, are able to read a blog created by them or other users.

## Getting Started

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/st-pardon/blogging-api.git 
$ cd blogging-api/
```
- Install packages and dependecies
```sh
$ npm install
```
- Create a `.env` file and  Set up every environmental variable required
    > see [.env](./config/README.md) for required variables
